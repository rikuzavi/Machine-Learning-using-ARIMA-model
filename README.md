# Machine-Learning-using-ARIMA-model

This project is based on forecasting Temperature using past 7 days hourly temperature data set.
Data set is on real time data a person have to take data for past 7 days then apply this algorithm.
website for dataset :-https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/india/kolkata/historic

ARIMA MODEL :- This is a basic time series forecasting model which uses a auto regression technique to forecast future data. ARIMA(Auto Regression Integration Moving Average) in this project we will use pmdarima python package.

Code editor used :- PYCHARM Ide.
DESCRIPTION :-

1)Data files used :-
  weather_data.csv -> used for storing past 7days data 
  predicted.csv -> used for storing the predicted data used for finding RMSE(Root mean square error)
  forecasted.csv -> used for storing the forecasted data

2)Exploring dataset :-
  first 5 data in the data set ->
